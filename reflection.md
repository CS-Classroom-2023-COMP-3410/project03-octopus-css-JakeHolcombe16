I faced a few challenges with the lines under introduction and common octopus scpecies. I needed help with creating the borders for the sections, AI helped me do those. I did the main-content section on my own mostly, somethings like the colored bullet points I didn't know how to do. I used AI to figure out the lines previously mentioned and for the quiz and table at the bottom, though, they had problems that I had to solve manually.
